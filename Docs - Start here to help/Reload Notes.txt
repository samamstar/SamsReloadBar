This file is just some simple notes on how long each gun takes to reload w/out mods.
The "round chambered" data was gathered with screen capture software and a stopwatch. 
Note that each time is the frame that the ammo on the hud first changes

If someone figures out where that value is stored I'd love to have some more accurate data! For now the experimentation method will work

Weapon ready time is 500ms
